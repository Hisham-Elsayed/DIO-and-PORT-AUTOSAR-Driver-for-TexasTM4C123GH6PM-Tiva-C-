# DIO-and-PORT-AUTOSAR-Driver-for-TexasTM4C123GH6PM-Tiva-C-
Aim for this project to Toggle Led output using Button as an input.

Requirements:
1. Button is considered pressed if it reads high for 60ms.

2. Button is considered released if it reads low for 60ms.

3. Led Output needs to be refreshed every 40 ms.

MCUAL -> DIO Driver.

ECUAL -> Led and Button Drivers.

Services Layer -> Schedular.

Application -> Systems Logic.


➢ Implemented DIO AUTOSAR Driver for TexasTM4C123GH6PM (Tiva-C).

➢ Implemented a full module test for the DIO AUTOSAR Driver.

➢ Implemented a simple scheduler based on Time-Trigger design  technique.

➢ Designed and implemented the full project using Software Layered  architecture (Dynamic and Static Design). 

➢ Implemented PORT AUTOSAR Driver for Texas  TM4C123GH6PM (Tiva-C).
